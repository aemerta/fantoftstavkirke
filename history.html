                <h2>The Begining of conversion </h2>
                <p>The effort to try converting Norway to Christianity 
                    began in 1000 AD. The vikings got too know Christianity after the raids 
                    on Ireland, Britain and the Frankish kingdoms. Haakon the Good of Norway
                    had grown up in England and tried to introduce Christianity in the 
                    tenth century. Unfortunatly for him he met resistance from pagan leaders
                    and had to abandon the idea.
                </p>

                <p>Anglo-Saxon missionaries from England and Germany 
                    tried to convert Norway to Christianity, but did not succed. Luckily, 
                    they did manage to convert Olaf I of Norway to Christianity. Olaf II of 
                    Norway was more persuasive, and did succed in a much larger scale in his
                    effort to convert the norwegian people. And today he is known for being
                    the man who christened the Norwegian population.

                <h2>Establishment of Christianity</h2>
                <p>The Christians in Norway often built churches or 
other holy sites at the same places that had previously been sacred 
under the Norse religion. Since the pagans were buried with grave goods 
and christians werent, this is used to measure the spread of the 
conversion. By the middle of the 11th century Christianity had become 
well established in Norway. And became more and more popular. By the 
middle of the 12th century it was the dominant religion. And the Stave 
churches started to appere.</p>

                <h2>Fantoft Stave Church Origin</h2>
                <p>Fantoft stave church history is about 800 years. The 
church was originally built in the small village Fortun in Sogn in about
 year 1200. Until the end of the 1800s it worked as a church for the 
little village at the foot of sognefjellet. There used to be 
approximately 1000 stave churches in Norway, but as the years passed and
 christianity grew, they had to give way to larger and more modern 
church buildings. This was also the faith of the stave church in Fortun.
 After a while it was replaced with a new church.</p>

                <h2>Abandonned and Saved</h2>
                <p>As The old church was no longer in use they could not
 afford to maintain it. On top of that villagers started to remove parts
 of the church to use it in there own farms. A Curator in Bergen beacame
 aware of the situation and gained financial support and started the 
proccess of moving the Church to Bergen. The manged to make a deal with 
Consul Gade who was owner of Fantoft farm, and the Church was relocated 
to this place in 1883. The same place were it lies today.</p>

                <h2>Burned and Rebuilding</h2>
                <p>In 1992 Fantoft stave church was damaged by fire.  In
 1998, 6 years later, the rebulilding of the church was finished. In the
 rebuilding of the church they used ca. 350-400 years old pine trees 
form Kaupanger as timber. They rebuilt it to look identical to the way 
ut was before the fire. And this is the way it is today.</p>

                <p>The crucifix on the altar survived the fire and was 
recovered in the ash in such condition that it be restored.

                    Wishing stone on the wall outside likdøren is also 
the original and is brought back from Jerusalem by pilgrims. By keeping 
the one could wish for something not mundane.</p>
